Swarm Dispersion Algorithm:  
There are two distributed algorithms: Uniform Dispersion and Moving through the shortest path.
   

Uniform Dispersion 
1. Python is used to do calculation to update the state of No.6 zebro.  
2. Matlab is used as the simulation environment and does the calculation for other zebros. 

Input:  
Coordinates of zebros.(coordinates are used to get relative position between neighbors)

Output:  
Coordinates of zebros

How to execute the code:  
Open zebros.m in Matlab and press 'F5'.


Algorithm version:  
Simple Version.   

Later Work:  
To simultate the movement more realistic as zebros. 
To Filter the jitter during movement.


Moving Through Shortest Path  
Matlab is used to do calculation as well as the simulation environment. 

1. Perform Uniform Dispersion/Coverage.
2. Calculate and highlight the shortest path between two zebros,
   use other zebros as in-between node.	
3. The source zebro moves to the destination zebro by shortest path.

How to execute the code:  
Open zebros.m in Matlab and press 'F5'.

State:  
Completed
