Swarm Dispersion Algorithm:  
This is a distributed algorithm for swarm dispersion.   
1. Python is used to do calculation to upadte the state of No.6 zebro.  
2. Matlab is used as the simulation environment and does the calculation for other zebros. 

Input:  
Coordinates of zebros.(coordinates is used to get relative position between neighbors)

Output:  
Coordinates of zebros

How to execute the code:  
Open zebros.m in Matlab and press 'F5'.


Algorithm version:  
Simple Version.   

Probelm: zebros can turn any angle for single iteration, which can make  
the movement like a jitter.
