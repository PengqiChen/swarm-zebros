Swarm Dispersion Algorithm:
This algorithm is to disperse swarm. 
1. Python is used for calculation to upadte the state of No.6 zebro.
2. Matlab is used as the simulation environment and does the calculation for other zebros. 


How to execute the code:
Open zebros.m in Matlab and press 'F5'.


Algorithm version:
Simple Version. zebros can turn any angle for single iteration, which can make
the movement like a jitter.
